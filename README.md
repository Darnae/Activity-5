Reading From A File


In this assignent I was tasked with several specifics among reading a file. First, I had to include Open Dialogue controls, second, to convert all words from the choosen file to lower case, third, to find the first and last word alphabetically, fourth, find the longest word, and lastly, find the word with the most vowels.
I had to display these stats in text boxes. As my screen shots show, I did so using multiple textboxes that have labels beside them.


My code to this program is the first screenshot under the header "Code" in my attached file. I also included a screen shot of the file used for this assignment. The last two photos are of my program running successfully without errors.
